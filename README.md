# Olympic Games Medals Table

This repository is an ongoing personal project combining my passion for sport with data science. The goal of the project is to develop a web platform to visualize some Olympic Games medal tables ranked by diverse ways.


## Context

At the end of each Olympiad, people like to compare the States according to their sporting performances in order to see if we are more athletic than our neighbors. To do that, they use the table of medals, judge of peace of the Olympic results. However, this type of ranking is often criticized and is not general enough : 
* 🥇🥈🥉 why only use 3 medals? From 1984 onward, athletes placing on the top 8 received certificates, known officially as Olympic diplomas.
* 🥇 vs 🥉 why 1 gold medals worths more than any amount of silver/bronze medals? If Michael Phelps were a country, he would be 38th on all-time Olympics gold medal table ! And 10th on  2008 Beijing Olympics, above countries including France, Netherlands, Brazil, Canada or even Spain.
* 2️⃣🥉 why some sports, such as Judo, awards 2 bronze medals? In karate, judo, taekwondo, and wrestling tournaments, repechages address the possibility of two top competitors meeting in an early round, allowing the loser a chance to compete for a bronze medal. But why it's not the case for the other sports?

Moreover, the current medal table can not be interpreted to determine the world's top sporting nations. Some sports such as cricket or squash are non olympics. And for some the best athletes does not compete : 
* 🔫 vs 🏐 with all due respect to shooting sports, why 10 meter air pistol counts as much as water polo event? They are individual and collective events.
* 🎾 vs 🏀 why a tennis double counts as much as a handball team? For the collective events, some of them needs numerous substitutes.


## How to use it 

 
These models can be applied on:

* 📝 Text, 🖼️ Images,  🗣️ Audio

```python
>>> from transformers import pipeline

# Allocate a pipeline for sentiment-analysis
```


When one of those backends has been installed, can be installed using pip as follows:

```bash
pip install test
```


```shell script
conda install -c  transformers
```
